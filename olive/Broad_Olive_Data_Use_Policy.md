Data Use Policy
===============

Our goal is to make sequence data rapidly and broadly available to the
scientific community as a community resource. It is our intention to
publish the work of this project in a timely fashion, and we welcome
collaborative interaction on the project and analyses.

However, considerable investment was made in generating these data and
we ask that you respect rights of first publication and acknowledgment
as outlined in the Toronto agreement [Toronto International Data
Release Workshop Authors. Prepublication data sharing. Nature. 2009
Sep 10;461(7261):168-70].

By accessing these data, you agree not to publish any articles
containing analyses of genes or genomic data on a whole genome or
chromosome scale prior to initial publication by the Broad Institute
and its collaborating scientists.

If you wish to make use of restricted data for publication or are
interested in collaborating on the analyses of these data, please
contact the project scientist through the link below.

Any redistribution of these data should include the full text of the
data use policy.
